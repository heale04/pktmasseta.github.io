###### Pride

Despite the academic demands of a school like MIT, about 25% of the house finds time to show off their skills. And for those of us who aren't on the team, nothing's better than getting out of class and supporting a brother and the MIT team. Whatever it is, you're sure to see a Phi Kap on the team.

###### Varsity Athletes

Phi Kaps are a dominant presence in all kinds of Varsity sports. From football to volleyball, brothers devote their time and effort to MIT Athletics. Two brothers, Brian Anderson '04 and Ben Schmeckpeper '05, have distinguished themselves as NCAA All-Americans. Just one example of the dedication Phi Kaps put into their sports.

###### Fun and Games

IM sports are the chance to put your skills to the test, without the commitment that comes along with a varsity sport; no pressure, just fun. Whomever you are, and whatever you're interested in, there's an intramural league for it at MIT. And chances are, we've got a team of guys just waiting for that season to start.

###### Championships

PKT throws its hat into the ring in countless IM sports with much success. In years past we've brought home championships in basketball, football, softball, bowling, frisbee, and tennis.
