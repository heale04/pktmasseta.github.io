###### Pride

Despite the academic demands of a school like MIT, many members of the house find time to show off their skills. And for those of us who aren't on the team, nothing's better than getting out of class and supporting a brother and the MIT team. Nothing's more fun than seeing your friends excell!

###### Varsity Athletes

Phi Kaps are a dominant presence in all kinds of Varsity sports. From fencing to crew to squash, brothers devote their time and effort to MIT Athletics.

###### Fun and Games

IM sports are the chance to put your skills to the test, without the commitment that comes along with a varsity sport; no pressure, just fun. Whomever you are, and whatever you're interested in, there's an intramural league for it at MIT.

###### Championships

PKT throws its hat into the ring in countless IM sports with much success. In years past we've brought home championships in basketball, football, softball, bowling, frisbee, and ultimate frisbee.
