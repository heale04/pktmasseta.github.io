###### Home

Living at PKT is an introduction to people, opinions, hobbies, and places that a person doesn't normally come across by himself. Our house is a collection of individuals united not by a common interest in sports or partying, but by friendship and brotherhood. Phi Kappa Theta is more than a place to live, it is a place to call home. The friendships made here last a lifetime.

###### Chapter Trips

Since there are less than 50 of us, no one ever gets lost in the crowd and it is easy for everyone to get to know each other. At the same time, there are enough of us that there is always someone to hang out with, discuss politics or sports, or take a weekend trip to visit our other chapters in New England.

###### Coffeehaus

Held once each term, this event is similar to an open-mike comedy night for the house. It consists mostly of skits and songs that poke fun at ourselves, different pledge classes, or the house in general. Coffeehaus gives us time to unwind from the semester, and is always a lot of fun.

###### Class Competitions

Often each year, we hold this event to bring the entire house together for an afternoon or day together. According to pledge class, we compete in random games and contests such as croquet, Jeopardy, pool & ping-pong, and the annual dance contest. Class pride is fierce, but everyone ends the day after a few taunts and laughs, and new bonds.

###### House Retreat

Every year, our Personnel Director organizes a house retreat dedicated to assessing the direction of the chapter. In the past, the entire house has gone camping, gone to retreat centers, had lock-ins, and others.
