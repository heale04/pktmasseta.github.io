"MIT and Boston provide a rich diversity of people and experiences throughout our college years. At Phi Kappa Theta, we are actively involved with all of these opportunities from academics to community service. Although we all devote a significant emphasis on schoolwork, brothers also participate in Varsity sports, musical groups, and other campus organizations. Socially, we organize several events each year for MIT and neighboring college students and also contribute regularly to our community. Yet, we also take great pride in the strength of our brotherhood, striving for our ideals and motto." - Sisir Botta '04
