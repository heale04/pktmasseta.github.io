year: 2019
brothers:
  - initials: BJO
    name: Benjamin Oberlton
    activities: League of Legends, Go, Curing Cancer, Running
    major: Course 20 - Biological Engineering
    hometown: Kennasaw, GA
    quote: 黑曼巴
    nickname: Facebook
    blurb: >
      Ben is a social beast. He plows through meeting new people on social media and in real life. That's just how he rolls. He is loves Chinese food, people, and culture. While Ben thinks he has unparalleled physical fitness…yeah he actually is probably the most cut PKT brother. However, his newfound addiction to video games and Chinese food will prove to his downfall. Let's just hope he cures cancer before that.
  - initials: VXF
    name: Vahid Fazel-Rezai
    activities: TechX, ProjX, HMMT, ultimate frisbee, math
    major: Course 6-3 - Computer Science
    hometown: Grand Forks, ND
    quote: Heelllooo? ( •̀ o •́ )_/¯
    nickname: Fazzlerazzle
    blurb: >
      Vahid is the most talkative, social brother of the 19s. Which is kind of surprising when you think about it since he grew up in North Dakota! Yes, people actually live there. When he's not lighting up a room with his gregarious personality -- or pulling a triple all-nighter to finish his 8 psets -- you can find him on the field playing a spontaneous game of sportsball. He may seem a bit intense when you first meet him, but deep down he's truly a very sweet, talented, humble guy. Probably because he's actually from Canada (no, like he's actually Canadian, pls don't tell the cops). Anyway, talk to Vahid! He loves talking.
  - initials: FAS
    name: Fernando Sanchez
    activities: Memorizing facts, MIT Pistol Team, Gettin' swole, Being watered, Topiary
    major: Course 18C - Mathematics with Computer Science
    hometown: Chatsworth, CA
    quote: I need an adult
    nickname: Fern
    blurb: >
      Like all of his fellow members of the Pteridophyta phylum, Fern began his life as a humble spore and spent many days undergoing vigorous mitosis before growing into the proud, leafy thicket we all know and love. Fern's true coming-of-age came during his days as a high school student in the Valley, when he regularly studied and photosynthesized for upwards of 40 hours a day to ensure that he would earn the highest score in Academic Decathlon history as a senior. (Fern no longer holds this record, but as he'll tell you, this is total bullshit, since the scores this year were hella inflated and he's still number one all time.)
      As a half-Indonesian, half-Mexican who also maintains a poetry blog, Fern is responsible in more ways than one for improving the overall culture of PKT. He likes listening to music that was made by anyone who is Korean and female, and he likes playing video games that were made by the folks who make League of Legends. Due to his subtle wit, his Wikipedia-like knowledge of 19th century French painters, and the flashes of true, virtuoso-like brilliance he displays at pong, Fern is also a well-liked presence around the house. One of the most personable shrubs you'll ever meet, Fern is definitely worth spending some time with if you get a chance; it's much more fun than watching grass grow.
  - initials: LXC
    name: Lokhin Cheng
    activities: Football, Cooking, League
    major: Course 6-2 - Electrical Engineering Computer Science
    hometown: Green Bay, Wisconsin
    quote: How's the Rabbit cake?
    nickname: Chef Logan Airport
    blurb: >
      Lokhin Cheng was born in the hillside valleys of China and grew up in the tundra of Green Bay Wisconsin. Raised with football in his veins, he's watched the highs and lows of his favorite football team – the Packers. As his nickname indicates, he's a highly competent chef, dedicating even six+ hours to perfect dishes, referring to lessons from working at his aunt's Chinese restaurant. If you run into Chef Logan, you'll probably find him making up phrases and pronunciations that only he can understand. You might find him enjoying some "rabbit cake," or practicing the art of "torched field warfare." Lokhin is one of the most dedicated and hard working brothers at PKT as you'll normally find him in his room working hard on a PSET while singing out of tune to Maroon 5 and Coldplay. Be sure to get to know Lokhin, one of the nicest brothers of the class of 2019.
  - initials: SXM
    name: Santiago Munoz
    activities: Soccer, Basketball, Chess, Drawing, Sleep, Puzzles, Fishing, League, Dota
    major: Course 6-2 - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Course 2 - Mechanical Engineering
    hometown: Atlixco, Mexico
    quote: Dude, it'll be huge.
    nickname: Santi
    blurb: >
      Hailing from the sunshine state, Santiago is a man of many talents. From the beginning, Santi was destined to be a great soccer player. Instead of accepting one of his many offers to play in the English Premier League, Santi decided to take his talents to Cambridge and join the PKT intramural team. As hardworking as he is gifted, Santiago plans on majoring in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer science. When he's not psetting or breaking ankles on the soccer field, you'll find Santi partying hard or blowing off steam with some League of Legends.
  - initials: ASL
    name: Anthony Liu
    activities: HackMIT, TechX Devops, Piano, Learn Hack Build
    major: Course 6-3 - Computer Science
    hometown: Daly City, CA
    quote: dude that's so cool!
    nickname: Ant
    blurb: >
      Anthony Liu brings his charm to MIT from the coast of California. They call him Ant, not because it happens to be the first three letters of his name, but because of the fact that he can lift hundreds of times his body weight. Half-Brazilian and half-Chinese, he can do virtually anything when he combines his intelligence with artificial intelligence. He's currently working on a Javascript program to fix global warming, and after that he plans to start a company that uses machine learning to schedule your day. Until then, you can always count on him to brighten your day with his sweet smile or dazzle your ears with his piano improv. Cheerful, kind, and valiant, he's one of the best guys you can get to know around MIT.
  - initials: JAZ
    name: Joe Zurier
    activities: TechX, THINK, Traders, Lifting, Frisbee
    major: Course 18 - Mathematics
    hometown: Providence, RI
    quote: Nope, that's not the one
    nickname: Icarus
    blurb: >
      Joseph Abraham Zurier was born into the dark, solemn village of Rhode Island. In the same way that goldfish grow to the size of their bowls, so did the people of this small village; young Joseph and his people were inexplicably small, both in height and in gains. As young Joseph progressed through school and life, he developed a particular affinity for mathematics. The legend has it that he completed AP Calculus by 8th grade, a feat accomplished by a phenomenal few. The summer after his Freshman year of high school, the young Joseph Abraham got his first taste of life beyond the small village of Rhode Island. He attended a summer program for mathematics in Boston called "PROMYS" to further advance his mathematical education in ways his small town high school could not. Young Joseph's time at PROMYS was a formative experience. After being exposed to the vast world of mathematics, young Joseph's body, like that of the goldfish, expanded to fill his new world and he grew a whopping 6 feet almost overnight. Today he stands at a proud 6'3" (although he ironically despises computer science) as the second tallest brother in the house. No longer the small child he once was, a newly developed Joe returned from PROMYS ready to conquer every challenge that came his way. After three more years of high school (and three more summers of PROMYS), Joe found his way to MIT and our fraternity. Though Joe had grown to heights beyond that of the average human, he still possessed the gains of a newly born goldfish and at MIT he was determined to change that. Under the guidance of Brophet Sidd [blessed be His name] Joe lifted his first bar and has sworn to never turn back. On his journey to make the gains Joe has faced many struggles such as the Day of Legs or the Chicken of the Maseeh Desert, yet he has survived them all. Joe has applied this same determination to his academics as well, taking the highest math offered for undergraduates in Freshman year. Being the most academically successful of the 19's is an incredible feat, but can Joe maintain his success? Joe hopes to soar high above the others, but will he, like Icarus, lose his wings and fall? Only time will tell. For now, only one thing is certain: Joseph Abraham Zurier flies high and proud among the class of 2019.
  - initials: AWW
    name: Aaron Wubshet
    activities: MIT consulting group, Electricity and Magnetism TA
    major: Course 6-1 - Electrical Science and Engineering
    hometown: Atlanta, GA
    quote: Uhhhh... I'm in McCormick
    nickname: wubs
    blurb: >
      Hailing from the beautiful Atlanta Georgia, this man could not help but take every gold medal that was given in high school Science Olympiad. Not that there are some other kids from Georgia that are salty or anything, it's just a fun fact. Anyway, Wubshet has a niche for just making sure everything goes smoothly. Whether that be TAing an 8.02 class and making sure your pset gets in on time, making sure some randos that Kushan let into a PKT party don't start up any trouble, or making sure that he is well rested during a 12 hr. 2019 PKT Team coding challenge, Wubshet will make sure he is ready to help. In all realness, Wubshet makes sure that when things get out of hand that everyone comes back to Earth and is able to think rationally about what is going on around them. He is an integral part of the PKT Class of 2019 and we don't know what we would do without him.
  - initials: EML
    name: Eric Lujan
    activities: SIPB, Hacking, Dank Memes, Photography, Tolerating Course 18's
    major: Course 6-2 - Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
    hometown: Las Vegas, NV
    quote: The grass in the courtyard is dead
    nickname: Dank Memes
    blurb: >
      Born and raised in the land of gambling, legalized prostitution, midget Eiffel Towers, Trump Hotels, and Harry Reid that is Nevada, Eric Lujan led a life of unprecedented sophistication. While attending the most prestigious high in Nevada, Coronado High School, Eric cultivated his sense of culture and taste - slowly learning the valuable skill of crafting the masterpieces that are today known as Dank Memes. Having outgrown his desert utopia, Eric set his sights, only slightly obstructed by hipster glasses and a camera viewfinder, for MIT. Nowadays one can find Eric working away at the Student Information Processing Board, climbing on top of rooftops (shhh), or hanging out at East Campus, where his home-baked cookies and hot chocolate comfort weary PSet-ers from miles around. If the situation is dire, one can also summon Eric Lujan by blasting his infamous call which can be heard at https://goo.gl/CMfOA3
      One might say the greatest honor that Eric Lujan will bestow on a fellow human being is the honor of being on his email list. It is rumored that the transcendent high one derives from being added to "I-like-you-for-some-reason" rivals that of tripping on acid and cocaine at the same time. When one is not receiving dank emails from Eric detailing PSet plans or food runs, one can still marvel at his stunning photography that covers his Facebook wall like tents cover Kresge.
