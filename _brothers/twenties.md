    blurb: >
      Hailing from the suburbs of Lexington, Massachusetts, it is unclear whether this Twerk God was raised as a child prodigy, or if he was naturally born as one. From randomly discovering that he has a phenomenal voice to sing with, to humbly demolishing 6.437 psets in one night, it is clear that David is a brother truly worth the name. David is one of the most organized and put together brothers at PKT -- whether organizing serenades for the entire group, leading the way at parties, or solving puzzles at midnight, you'll never find yourself bored around him. On a typical weekday, you'll find him a disciplined ROTC man: working out, psetting with brothers, and even getting in some time to grab dinner with his many ladies. But on a weekend, it's a bit of a different story.
      However, even given his superhuman capabilities, David will never admit it -- he is one of the most kind, bright, and chill brothers that Phi Kappa Theta has to offer. Never be afraid to hang out with David -- you'll find out that there's much more to him than it first seems.
  - initials: FXN
    name: Faraaz Nadeem 
    activities: Mirchi, Asian Dance Team, Muslim Students Association, Machine Intelligence Community
    major: Course 6-3 - Computer Science
    hometown: Lexington, MA
    quote: Mohabbat hai Mirchi
    nickname: Raaz
    blurb: >
      I was shooting the shit in a little coffeeshop off 11th when my ears whiffed a conversation between a couple dudebros by the bar. One of them asked "How do I get a damsel's dhol drumming?" The other flexed his pecs a bit and spewed some recycled Pornhub-sidebar-advertisement BS and the two smugly returned to their lives of ignorance.
      I slurped to the dregs of my single-source Kenyan latte as fondness turned my vision a shade of mocha, and I remembered the one man who really got those dhols drumming.
      I asked my mother about the day Faraaz was born and she almost fainted from happiness. She said Allah carried him down from the heavens while Lord Shiva danced the Electric Boogaloo and Yahweh skipped through hemp fields with Jesus Christ on his back. A myriad of maidens simultaneously announced their engagement to the newborn and from the countless brawls of passion that followed, the sport of wrestling was born.
      The chocolate child Faraaz paid no attention to these diversions. 100,000 rupee dowries didn't interest him. 1's and 0's did. A dalliance in the digital became a full-blown passion in his junior year, where he taught himself the poetry of Course 6 and published apps garnering thousands of downloads. 
      But Faraaz was a heartless man. Rather than seek profit, he sought to help the homeland. In his senior year of high school, he built an app to make vital information accessible in the various vernaculars of India.
      His intellectual pursuits continued to the hallowed halls of MIT. Outside of classes, he laid down his running baton and picked up the Sapp. With practically no prior dance experience, Faraaz became a star on Mirchi, MIT's Indian fusion dance team. On the proving grounds of the dance floor he trained his body to be as lithe and sultry as a panther and as explosive as an IED. Newcomers to MIT would occasionally see lines of women stretching from Kresge to Sloan. They'd shrug it off, thinking Beyonce was in town. Little did they know these hearts were aflutter in anticipation of a Mirchi performance, and the few minutes they'd have to bask in the glory of Faraaz Nadeem.
      When Faraaz pledged to Phi Kappa Theta as a sophomore, the universe almost faced an apocalypse. Having PKT and Faraaz Nadeem mix, arguably the two most perfect things in existance, put the balance of good and bad out of whack. Braving the Crimson Staircase of Doom, Faraaz reached the top to ask the saintly Rush Chair what to do. Minutes before the collapse of Earth's core, a solution was found. In an act of true selflessness, Faraaz ascended to the realm of angels, forever becoming the divine protector of PKT.
      I ran out of the coffeshop before the others could see my tears of remembrance. Later that day, I made sure to drive on the footpath on the way home. I smiled as the divine voice of Faraaz rang in my ears. "Shabash beta, shabash!"

Legend has it that when this godly specimen walks into a party, the ladies come flocking.
