  - initials: KXY
    name: Kidus Yohannes

      On every day, at every hour, during every minute, this brother is the talk of the town of MIT. Greeting hundreds of people between classes in the infinite corridor and running our most iconic social events at PKT - to many he sounds like a deity or legend. But to us he is the kind soul named Kidus that blesses our fraternity. Hailing from the great country of Ethiopia, Kidus has his eyes on changing the world. As an innovator, he’s involved in a multitude of startups in industries from EdTech to Tourism looking to better the next generation. As a leader, he holds multiple executive positions in MIT’s premier business and entrepreneurship clubs. As an engineer, he can build any website out back to front. And when he’s not working on his next project, he enjoys curating his next instagram-worthy photo, supporting his Man City side, or religiously listening to The Weekend. It’s time to roll out the carpet, cause MIT’s next superstar is on his way.

    name: Max Tan
    activities: Club Tennis, Startlabs, Pokerbots, MIT Consulting Group
    major: Physics 😎 and EECS (6-2)
    hometown: Manlius, NY

      Hailing from Syracuse, NY, the Tax Man is a quiet but gentle spirit. When he's not collecting dues as treasurer (appropriate role given the name), he can be found unknowingly charming all with his good looks and genius craft. Well experienced and accomplished from his Exeter days, Max continues to excel at all that he does. From performing in MIT's orchestra to hitting balls (with a tennis racquet of course!) to discovering the Grand Unified Theory, Max is a jack of all trades. With these musical, creative, athletic, and intellectual qualities, Max is most clearly a sort of renaissance man, if you will (still can't beat Ian in FIFA though). Statistically, you can't win them all, but Max is clearly an outlier.

      This here is a beast of a man. Although he did not come from a very prestigious high school, he has easily shown that he deserves to be at MIT. This magnificent man has no bounds as he is a jack of all trades. Intelligence, check. Athletic prowess, check. Humor, check. An absolute stud, check. Party animal, definitely check. He is an easily approachable guy that many people love to be around. However, like many other unfortunate students at MIT, he has converted to become a 6-3 major. Originally planning to be a physics major, he fell into the trap of the course called 6.0001 and found that he actually enjoyed coding. In fact, either through enjoyment or insanity, he filled his second semester mostly with coding courses, sacrificing countless nights of sleep. While it is a shame that he has joined the massive herd of Course 6's in MIT, his intelligence is demonstrated by his insane ability to handle all these Course 6 assignments, whether efficiently or not, and he will be able to make more money in the future! This man is a monster in class, the court, and at parties.

  - initials: AZC
    name: Andrew Cai
    activities: Introspection, Math/Computer Science projects, Basketball
    major: Mathematics and Computer Science (18-C)
    hometown: Houston, Texas 
    quote: "You build a thousand bridges but fuck one goat. You know what they'll call you? A goat fucker."
    nickname: 
    blurb: >
      Sometimes at MIT you forget how smart everyone is around you, Cai is one of those people who helps you remember. From math competitions to graduate classes in freshman year, there’s no question he’s intelligent. But, even deeper than his intellect is his ability as a self oriented leader which is most likely a consequence of his keenness for introspection. He regularly reflects on every facet of his life and easily admits his shortcomings and strives to improve. Despite his tall achievements (or maybe even the reason for their existence in the first place) he is grounded in raw enthusiasm for his work, and an endless sight on something greater for the future. 
  - initials: TLM
    name: Taji Manning
    activities: Engineers without borders, UROP
    major:  6-9 and 8
    hometown: Los Angeles, CA

    nickname:
    blurb: >
      It’s a bird! It’s a plane! No, it’s Taji zooming through the streets of Boston on his electric bike. As is common with MIT students, Taji is infatuated with computers. However, less common is his desire to actually benefit society, unlike SWEs and Sloanies. Thus, he is interested in human centered innovations, such as human centered AI, computer vision, computer graphics, and computer human interfaces. Taji is also an avid 3D modeler, capable of vividly designing your deepest, darkest fantasies. Nevertheless, Taji’s most important trait is his genuine and unwavering compassion for others. Taji is always looking for a way to help people and he inspires those around him to do the same. He truly makes everyone feel valued and we are lucky to have him as part of our family.
