  - initials: RXC
    name: Raunak Chowdhuri
    activities: Running a biotech startup, singing, meditating, cycling, philosophy
    major: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (6-2)
    hometown: San Diego, CA
    quote: Six, eight, ten, hallelujah it's raining men!
    nickname: Nuktuk
    blurb: >
      They say to never follow someone off a cliff, but if it's Raunak going, it's probably the right way given his unwavering moral compass. Said compass keeps him modest, but his work speaks for itself. At one point he got so tired of job offers, he decided to start his own company. This comes on top of his many other pursuits in singing, cycling, philosophy, and research. You might wonder how Raunak gets so much done during the day, but he's got plenty of time, for he codes flawlessly in his sleep. Conveniently, he doesn't need much actual rest because he's living the dream. Raunak is the kind of person that immediately makes you feel like family, and we're so proud to have him as part of ours.

    name: Jake Yasonik
    activities: Running, Piano, Chess, MIT Consulting Group

      From the heart of mother Russia itself there comes a beast. It is not an avalanche, but as white as the snow that makes one up. Comrades, see now what has arrived: Jake P Yasonik! Killer of kilometers, pillager of pianos, ravager of rooks, and a born computational biologist, Jake is always down to have a BLAST. An academic powerhouse, when he’s not in the lab you can find him case-prepping at MCG. Yet despite his many successes, anyone who gets to know Jake will see that his is one of the humble, kind brothers anyone could ask for. One of the few brothers who has managed to avoid the siren’s song of SWE and Sloan, Jake has plans to actually improve the human condition through biotechnology and drug discovery. Having already secured a Big Pharma™ internship as a Freshman, we can be sure it won’t be long before his biotech inventions capture market share just as effectively as he captured all our hearts here at PKT.

    blurb: >
      At first, John's combination of charm, charisma, looks, and smarts may be hard to believe. Not only is John a man dedicated to his copious academic interests, such as ML, statistical interference, and biotechnology, but he is also extremely devoted to being the world's greatest C tier chess player, hiking, and Olivia Rodrigo. At night, John works on expanding his vast cultural knowledge through reading and TV shows, with The Boys, Attack on Titan, and 30 Rock being amongst his favorites. Regardless of whether you may find him putting in countless hours into his research, or exploring the vast, barren lands of Iceland, John is someone you can count on to always be there for you.
  - initials: GXA
    name: Gabriel Arruda
    activities: Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Blue Belt, Pokerbots, hiking, soccer, videogame enjoyer, MMA enthusiast
    major: Computer Science, Economics, and Data Science (6-14), Business Analytics (15-2)
    hometown: Miami, FL
    quote: LFGGGGG
    nickname: Fun sized
    blurb: >
      Hailing from the swamps of Miami, Gabriel Arruda is a man of many talents. Our beloved short king is an excellent cook, an acute businessman, and despite his stature, a man who can easily overwhelm you with a single leg takedown, leaving you violated like McGregor at UFC 229. As expected of someone whose blood is that of the greatest footballing nation, he is an avid soccer enthusiast (which is why it is strange that he would elect to support Tottenham), and he has spent more hours mastering rainbow flicks on FIFA than he has studying. Nonetheless, Gabe is an excellent student, a funny companion, and a steadfast brother.

    name: Irura Nyiha
    activities: African Students Association, UROP
    major: Physics (8)
    hometown: Nairobi, Kenya
    quote: Arsenal is better
    nickname: T’Challa
    blurb: >
      Irura Nyiha, a seductive man with stylish hair, gives off an aura of superiority and sophistication. However, as soon as you approach him, his warm and contagious smiles will melt the first impression away, along with any barriers between you and the man. It will not be long before you realize you are smiling with him. The man of Kenya, aka T’Challa, has realized at an early age that Africa is too small of a world for him to express his intelligence and talents. Soon after intellectually conquering his homeland of Africa, he took over the world. Too bored of the world, he now is looking beyond this planet, preparing to conquer the universe, secretly hiding his identity as a Physics student interested in Astronomy and Astrophysics. You will often see him walking around Boston by himself, imaging the near future of conquering the universe and looking for an opportunity to communicate with the aliens. In his free time with normal humans, you can catch him watching Game of Thrones and hydrating himself with seltzers after an intense game of football. You know he is a true Arsenal fan when he calls their sport “football.”

    major: Computer Science and Molecular Biology (6-7)
    hometown: Sugar Land, TX
    quote: Just one more
    nickname:
    blurb: >
      At MIT, there are smart people, really smart people, and absolutely smart people. Well, Nithin cannot be classified as any of those because he is an ABSOLUTE ULTRA SUPER LEGENDARY GENIUS. In high school, Nithin focused on conducting research and participating in the Olympiad in the biology field. Coming into MIT, Nithin also discovered his passion for entrepreneurship. He is a co-founder, and yes a freaking CO-FOUNDER, of Van Heron Labs. But set aside all these amazing attributes; seeing Nithin has presented everyone with a surprise—his height. Everyone at PKT thought Nithin was shorter than he is based on how he appeared on Zoom, but boom, he is taller than whatever you could imagine. The most important trait of Nithin, however, is his friendliness. His charming personality with his great jokes brings smiles to everyone at PKT. He is THE GUY you want to be friends with.
