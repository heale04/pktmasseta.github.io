    blurb: >
      They say to never follow someone off a cliff, but if it's Raunak going, it's probably the right way given his unwavering moral compass. Said compass keeps him modest, but his work speaks for itself. At one point he got so tired of job offers, he decided to start his own company. This comes on top of his many other pursuits in singing, cycling, philosophy, and research. You might wonder how Raunak gets so much done during the day, but he's got plenty of time, for he codes flawlessly in his sleep. Conveniently, he doesn't need much actual rest because he's living the dream. Raunak is the kind of person that immediately makes you feel like family, and we're so proud to have him as part of ours.
