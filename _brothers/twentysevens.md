      Hey y’all! I’m Michael and I was born and raised in College Station, Texas. I’m planning on majoring in course 6-3 (computer science) and course 18 (mathematics). I chose PKT because of how diverse and supportive the community was. The brothers have all been extremely accepting and helpful in regards to navigating life at MIT. Outside of PKT, I'm on the Men's Varsity Swim and Dive team where I mostly swim sprint butterfly and freestyle.

      Hey everyone! I’m Francis and I’m a first-year planning to major in 6-14. I’m from Lexington, which is a suburb of Boston (around 20-30 minutes from MIT). PKT has been extremely impactful experience for me in a bunch of ways. Coming to the house and engaging in all of the events has really given me a sense of community and a home away from home, and the brothers have been an unwavering source of mentorship and support. Outside of my classes, I'm on the OC for the Sloan Sports Analytics Conference and a pitcher for the baseball team. I'm a hard-core country music fan and my diet consists solely of Chipotle and Sweetgreen.

      Alex is one of the smartest brothers you'll ever meet. You won't catch him wasting away his life with unfruitful games of beer pong. Instead, he'll spend those Friday nights in the most fruitful adventures within the halls of McCormick. Beyond the impact he's already made at McCormick, Alex wants to make an impact on the world at large. He's already inspiring the younger generation by his riveting lectures at PokerBots. One attendee of these lectures, who happens to be a resident at McCormick, commented that they were a tour de force of erudition, a tear-jerking marriage of theory and practice. Oh the places he will go!

    major: Biological Engineering (20)
    hometown: Chicago, Illinois
    quote:
    nickname: Sun Pzu
    blurb: >
      If you see what looks like an Asian dad swerving at 20mph on an electric scooter across Boston, it's probably Peter Pu. Known enthusiast of clementines, Dirty Water Dough Company, and Gal Gadot, Peter is the last person you'll ask for advice (or first, but just to hear what he'll say). His forays into the corporate world via Sloan Business Club and Global Positioning Systems don't exactly help his reputation for navigating the world free from the hindrances of a moral compass. In order to defend his title of MVP of the MIT D1 Crew team, he wakes up at 6am every morning to cruise to the boathouse, his hunting grounds. Even with all this on his plate, he still somehow spends most of his waking hours at his lab, where he can pursue his true passion of Biology research. To Peter, his journey towards his PhD always comes first - over his classes, his friends, and even his hygiene. It has been said that in one summer, he personally injected over 3 billion worms using only his God-given appendages and a pair of latex gloves (don't ask how). But even at the end of the day, with all his superhuman features and traits, Peter still faces the plight of the common man - on his quest for true love.

    major: Computer Science (6-3)
    hometown: Somerville, Massachusetts
    quote:
    nickname: KevDog
    blurb: >
      Kevin is a man of a multitude of interests - he isn't afraid of showing off his pool skills, twitches at the sight of a lonely piano waiting to be played and pumps iron whenever the chance is obtained. When he is not sending the most outrageous reels on Instagram or working on his project to map all the interiors of MIT, he can be seen having fun with his friends on campus and brothers at PKT. With his immense passion for Math+CS, intense eye contact abilities and immaculate vision, Kevin is a force to be reckoned with.

    name: James Liu
    activities: StartLabs, UROP, Lifting
    major: Artificial Intelligence & Decision Making (6-4)
    hometown: Boise, Idaho
    quote:
    nickname: Fluoride Stare
    blurb: >
      James is an enigmatic presence, hailing from the quiet expanses of Idaho, a place as unassuming as him, yet equally filled with hidden complexities. If you're lucky enough to catch his gaze, you'll be met with a stare so piercing it could only be described as menacing—a quiet testament to the depth and intensity that lies beneath his reserved exterior.

      In the realm of intellect, James is a force to be reckoned with. While many are still grappling with the basics, he's diving into complex algorithms and mathematical theories as naturally as breathing. But don't expect him to flaunt it; his brilliance is cloaked in a shyness that only makes you wonder more about the layers yet uncovered.

      James' duality shines most clearly in his unique set of interests. On one hand, he's a formidable League of Legends player, where his strategic acumen and killer instincts are unveiled. On the other, he oscillates between two seemingly contrasting states: a hermit-like focus that rivals ancient scholars, and a libidinous energy that most would find difficult to keep up with.

      This enigmatic blend of traits makes James an outlier in the most fascinating ways. Is he the brooding genius lost in his world of complex thoughts, or the playful youth living for visceral experiences? Maybe he's both, or maybe he's neither. What's certain is that James carries with him an intrigue so compelling, you can't help but want to know more.

      His introspection and self-awareness often have him oscillating between extremes, yet it is perhaps this very oscillation that forms the cornerstone of his genius. Always aware, always searching, and always unpredictable—James is a mystery we're all keen to solve, but one that refuses to be easily defined. With a future as enigmatic as his personality, we can only be certain that whatever path James chooses, it will defy all expectations. And that's precisely why he's an indispensable part of our circle.

      Don't blink or you'll miss Tino—the human blur on squash courts, soccer fields, and basketball arenas. The last thing you want to see in a soccer match is Tino barreling towards you. Off-field, he's the ultimate blend of goofy and charismatic, leading teams effortlessly. A fervent Manchester City supporter and Clash Royale maestro, he's charting an open future now that he's out of his quant phase. Short, sweet, and packed with punch - that's Tino.

      Hey everyone—my name is Sean Cheng, from Exeter, New Hampshire, and I'll probably major in AI and business. I decided to join PKT after I stayed there during CPW and got to meet the amazing and diverse group of people. I'm also a member of MIT Consulting Group, and play on the club soccer team. I don't like overloading and am well-known for not going to classes and making sure I get enough sleep. I've traveled a lot (favorite places: Alaska, the Azores, Peru) and hope to continue to explore the world and meet new people.

    name: Prince Debrah
    activities: Video Games
    major: Artificial Intelligence & Decision Making (6-4)
    hometown: Accra, Ghana
    quote:
    nickname: Ghana Steal Yo Girl
    blurb: >
      From the rhythmic depths of Accra, Ghana comes Prince Debrah—a man so intriguing he's known as "Ghana steal yo girl." Dreads flowing and smile glowing, Prince is a virtuoso of swag and intellect. He majors in 6-4 and dabbles in entrepreneurship, often juggling both like he's in a circus of brilliance.

      But let’s talk Friday nights. Prince has had a different charming companion every week this summer. That's 10 Fridays, 10 tales of romance, 10 chances for you to have your girl snatched. Yet, he can shift gears faster than a Bugatti. When he's not charming the MIT populace, he's diving into the complex world of League of Legends. Yes, he's ridiculed for it, but while you laugh, he's grinding—unapologetically committed to every game.

      As for academics, this man once breezed through a graduate Sloan course without even noticing it was a graduate class. His intellect isn't confined to textbooks, though. While washing dishes, he moonlights as a dance prodigy—hitting those fire dance moves like nobody's business, even when he thinks he's alone.

      This man’s athleticism? Mythical. Prince took one look at a pull-up bar and almost launched himself into orbit. He's PKT’s secret weapon in any athletic endeavor, boasting speed that makes mere mortals look like they're running on a treadmill.

      Above all, what sets Prince apart is his genuine kindness. Whether he's waving hello or lighting up a room with his smile, he has the sort of warmth that would make a bonfire jealous.

      So here's to Prince, the man who's just as comfortable in a grad class as he is in the heart-pounding arenas of love and LoL. A rising titan in both the digital and real worlds, and quite possibly the future baron of his own empire. Keep an eye on him; he's already stolen the show and, who knows, maybe he's about to "Ghana steal" something else next.

      If Brian had a life quote, it would be “work hard play hard.” On the weekday, you’ll see him grinding out psets, but on the weekends, you’ll also see him partying it up with the brothers. Fun guy with fun stories. Some would argue that he’s the social life of PKT (best assistant social chair fr). Brian Sheeeesh will always be the most iconic and down to earth person you’ll ever meet.

    hometown: Vancouver, Washington
    quote:
    nickname: Paco
    blurb: >
      From the (not so) nice city of Vancouver, Washington, Paco is on a mission to conquer the world of mathematics while grappling with some enticingly distracting obsessions.

      Paco's academic pursuits are punctuated by his semesterly descent into new and tantalizing vices. Like a moth drawn to a flame, he finds himself irresistibly ensnared by the allure of video games, particularly the intricate worlds of Tetris and Team Fight Tactics. These digital realms, while offering a temporary escape from the rigors of academia, often transform into captivating vices that threaten to devour his time and attention.

      The siren call of Tetris's falling blocks and the strategic allure of Team Fight Tactics have been both a blessing and a curse for Paco. As he navigates the complex algorithms of math during the day, the gravitational pull of these virtual challenges lures him into the depths of addictive gameplay during the night.

      However, like all great minds, Paco's pursuits come at a cost. His sleep schedule is frequently in shambles as he juggles his mathematical ambitions and the irresistible vice of video games. Fueled by a caffeine addiction that rivals his passion for math, Paco often burns the midnight oil to balance his academic responsibilities with his seductive obsessions.

      Amidst his quirks and captivating vices, Paco's Hispanic heritage and unique personality shine bright. His questionable taste in music only adds to his enigmatic charm, while his ability to embrace his roots and dive into new passions sets him apart.

      As Paco's journey at MIT unfolds, it's clear that he is not just a student of math, but a student of life itself, navigating the exhilarating highs and captivating vices that come with it. In his pursuit of knowledge, he leaves an indelible mark, showing that even the most tantalizing obsessions can't dim the brilliance of his mind or the uniqueness of his spirit.

      Hailing form Syosset, NY, Alex (wait which one again?) is one of those people that really makes MIT feel like home. From drunkenly staggering around at parties to carrying you on your psets, Alex does it all. It’s a combination of his kind, caring personality and blinding brilliance that truly signifies what to achieve success at MIT. Unfortunately, like the majority of the rest of his class, Alex has fallen to the dark side and begun dabbling in the dangerous arts of finance - pray for his soul before it gets to late.
