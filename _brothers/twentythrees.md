    name: Wilson Spearman
    activities: MIT StartLabs, Hiking, Documentaries
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Fort Mill, SC

      Everybody: Time to explore NYC! 
      Wilson: NO I NEED MY COFFEE FIRST
    nickname: Coffeeman
    blurb: >
      Wilson Spearman, a future entrepreneur, but also a man of family, both to the brotherhood and his young niece and nephew. Wilson has a profound interest in both Computer Science and Economics, making him the classic 6-14 sellout. Like a true MIT student, Wilson has already dominated the entrepreneurial world. At age 3, he began his entrepreneurial successes by starting a company that would film videos for various real estate agencies. Then he just decided to buy out the agencies instead. Over IAP, he taught a class on entrepreneurship far away in Georgia (the country, not the state) through Global Studies and Languages. Secretly he was just trying to claim his piece of that hot Eastern European market. Currently, Wilson aspires to be a successful founder for a world changing company and is passionate about working on problems that push him to be more unique and creative.  One day you'll catch him throwing around seed funding as a hot-shot investor, or raking in the big series funding bucks for his B2B neural network blockchain in the cloud startup.

    name: Thomas Ngo
    activities: >
      StartLabs, Asian American Association, CS:GO SMFC
    major: Computation and Cognition (6-9)
    hometown: San Jose, CA
    quote: Yo bruh wanna go gymming?
    nickname: The Musketeer
    blurb: >
      At first glance, Thomas Ngo looks to be the perfect varsity soccer player: Adidas sweatpants, charming good looks, and a fade so clean that it puts MIT Nano to shame. Unfortunately, he decided to forgo the competitions in the physical realm as he devotes himself to a higher task: to instill discipline in himself and others. Following ancient Buddhist beliefs, Thomas constantly seeks discomfort, whether it's in the Z making gains or exploring the heart of Boston late at night, shivering from the freezing cold, wondering why he ever decided to leave the comforts of San Jose. Thomas is a Vietnamese American, an identity that he continues to embrace and explore. You will find him in Vietnamese restaurants all over the greater Boston area, critiquing the richness of the broth and tasting the Vietnamese coffee. With all that said, we still haven't talked about the one part of Thomas that puts him near and dear to our hearts: his kindness. Thomas is one of the most caring, non-judgemental, and empathetic people you will ever meet; his eyes light up when he talks about his little brother, he always wants to hear how your day went, and he will be there for you through the good and the bad. We are lucky to have him as a '23, and have no doubt that he will make an impact in all of our lives here at PKT.

      Oh, and he will absolutely destroy you in CS:GO

    name: Frank Gonzalez
    activities: MIT Flying Club, UROP
    major: Aerospace Engineering (16)
    hometown: FL, GA, VA, Netherlands, Germany
    quote: I don't speak German
    nickname: Fronk the Tonk
    blurb: >
      Fronk the Tonk. He's lived in Florida, Georgia, Virginia, Netherlands, Germany, Massachusetts, and in the hearts of those he befriends. Despite spending his high school years in Germany, the only words he knows in German are "one bratwurst please". That's because he was too focused on his mission. His mission to further the reach of humanity to conquer the galaxy and beyond. He chooses to do this and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard. And this is one challenge Frank is willing to accept, and unwilling to postpone. Behind his beautiful baby face is a genius, and his wits will be enough to one day succeed at SpaceX, just like he succeeded in becoming an amazing person and brother of PKT.
  - initials: AYZ
    name: Andy Zhu
    activities: Sloan Business Club, Pokerbots, Chinese Student Club, Asian Dance Team, HHMT Organizer
    major: Math and Computer Science (18-C)
    hometown: San Diego, CA
    quote: All in
    nickname: AyZed
    blurb: >
      Andy: the man, the myth, the legend. From humble beginnings, Andy rose through the ranks of every high school math competition there is. But, don’t let his brainiacs fool you, Andy likes to live life on the edge. If there was one way to describe Andy, it would be going all in with pocket twos; a dangerous play, but maybe just enough to pull it off.  Outside of Andy’s calling to Poker and Quant Fiancé, he is a true king. A person who you can always call a friend, Andy will always be there to lend a helping hand.

    name: Darren Lim

    major: Computation and Cognition (6-9)
    hometown: Seattle, WA
    quote: It's all about the ratio
    nickname: The Chosen One
    blurb: >
      Darren Lim. The Chosen One. What more is there to say? He’s a computer wizz and app developer interested in figuring out how the brain works, but don’t let his mild manner fool you. Every time Darren is spotted on campus, it’s usually in the company of a flock of girls. While most brothers struggled to find a date to Semi Formal, Darren brought two. Legendary.

      In all honesty, Darren is one of the humblest, kindest brothers PKT has to offer, always willing to extend a hand, no matter the time, to help his friends. Truly a gentleman.

      Sir Mattyice is a humble being from Philly who tends to meander around Harvard’s campus in search of business people to connect with. As a man who hopes to work on Wall Street one day, Sir Mattyice will soon come to the realization that finance is not the way.  A man, full of potential, should not allow himself to become a finance man. IT IS NOT THE WAY! Yoda once said that the way is not finance but indeed the way is squash. Yes, Squash, the plant, not Squash the sport. Sir Mattyice’s true potential is growing squashes. At MIT, Sir Mattyice will learn to grow the best squashes in the world!

    blurb: >
      Shafim, Shafim, Shafim. Fencing king with fantastic, serenading swing. A local of Cambridge, Massachusetts himself, some say that he was born performing chaotic harmonies whilst on the top of the Great Dome so that anyone within a 5-mile radius could hear his fearless voice. Others believe that he came out of the womb wielding a 3-feet saber, ready to slash through his enemies in immaculate en garde position. Today, he blesses MIT's campus with his courageous, brave, and confident presence, whether it be by carrying literally everyone through serenades, effortlessly performing multiple solo pieces in front of dozens at a time, or counter-parrying anyone that dares get in his way towards success and happiness. Meet him in person, and you'll quickly realize that his down-to-earth and friendly personality makes you feel right at home. His loyalty to his personal values will bring respect that can withstand a thousand dimensions of code, and his ease and kindness will easily melt all your worries away.

    quote: Wait till y'all see my lab
    nickname: Tim the Beaver
    blurb: >
      Tim is an EE wizard, dad-joke extraordinaire, and superhuman athlete all rolled up into one incredible guy. It's widely rumored that Tim soldered his first circuit before he could even talk and hasn't stopped since then. Give him a few components and some time in his lab, and he'll emerge with the circuit of your dreams. If he's not in an EE lab, you can probably find him cycling. Unlike many brothers, Tim has never skipped leg day. Tim's greatest talent, however, is his ability to bring a smile to anyone's face. He is always able to drop the perfectly timed joke into every conversation. Tim is an incredible friend to all and PKT certainly wouldn't be complete without him.
