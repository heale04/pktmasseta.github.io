      Wilson Spearman, a future entrepreneur, but also a man of family, both to the brotherhood and his 4 year old nephew and 2 year old niece. Wilson has a profound interest in both Computer Science and Economics, making him the classic 6-14 sellout. Like a true MIT student, Wilson has already dominated the entrepreneurial world. At age 3, he began his entrepreneurial successes by starting a company that would film videos for various real estate agencies. Then he just decided to buy out the agencies instead. Over IAP, he taught a class on entrepreneurship far away in Georgia (the country, not the state) through Global Studies and Languages. Secretly he was just trying to claim his piece of that hot Eastern European market. Currently, Wilson aspires to be a successful founder for a world changing company and is passionate about working on problems that push him to be more unique and creative.  One day you'll catch him throwing around seed funding as a hot-shot investor, or raking in the big series funding bucks for his B2B neural network blockchain in the cloud startup.
