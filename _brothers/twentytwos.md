    blurb: >
      He doesn’t always speak, but when he does, he prefers “YEAH!” Alex Tran is the most interesting man in the world. He once defused a riot in Turkey by speaking Turkish… in French. When he writes in a textbook, it immediately increases in value. Once, he likened machine learning to teaching a dog to sit. He gives professors PSETS, and his tests come pre-marked with 100%. S^3 asks him for sick days, purely out of respect. He knows all forms of martial arts, including the three that only he knows. No human fully understands his story — because it’s too much knowledge for mere mortals. Not even we know all the details of Alex Tran’s existence, but as he always says — “Stay bros my friends.”
