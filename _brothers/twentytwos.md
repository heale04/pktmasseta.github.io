    name: Adit Abraham
    activities: Startlabs, Contrary Capital, reminiscing over wrestling
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Salisbury, MD
    quote: Hair dye is to be administered by professionals only.
    nickname: Adept Abe
    blurb: >
      Adit is a man who seeks opportunity. A sophomore rush, he dedicated his first year at the Institute to becoming the biggest entrepreneurship mans the world has ever seen. Now, hopeful undergraduate founders and sucessful entrepreneur alums alike approach him with zeal, hoping that Adit may grant them access to the enterprising community of MIT. Adit holds the keys to the castle, and by his unrivaled generosity we know there could be no better occupant of the throne.

      The Journey of Adit began at birth. Originally from New Dehli, the young boy moved to glorious Maryland at the precocious age of 8. He was an explorer, a seer of sights, a dabbler in youth wrestling, and when he finally came of age, he was enveloped by the blocky escape that is Minecraft. His survival skills were unrivaled, but his obsession eventually turned away from crafting networks of redstone and towards cultivating networks of <i>working professionals</i>. Adit became the unchallenged rival of LinkedIn, and even came close to connecting with the Daily Show's Hasan Minhaj. The DMs never stopped, opportunities flourished, and the man only found a worthy contender when he first entered the doors of PKT. 

      The Journey of Adit is far from over, and any man, woman, or child who has the honor to pass him by in the Infinite may be considered part of said Journey. Whatever his future may hold, it is inexorably linked to his brothers of Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity.

    activities: Rocket building, hair dying
    major: Aerospace Engineering (16)
    hometown: Phoenixville, PA
    quote: Guys, it's not a phase.
    nickname: Herbie
    blurb: >
      Herbert(1) M. Turner IV, the proud king of the Hurbitat, hails from the small pond known as Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. As a thicc fish, Herbs has always pursued difficult challenges in life. If none can be found, Herbie has been known to sabotage his own success in order to increase the rigor of life(2). This motivated attitude led HMT to attend Phillips Academy Andover! There King Turner flourished and a passion for AeroAstro was ignited. To this day, some still refer to him as “MatchStick”. Humble MatchStick refuses to create a LinkedIn, as he needs no praise for his accomplishments(3). Inspired by his own image, Herbert aspires to build big rockets!!

      (1)The M is abbreviated as profanities are not allowed on our brotherly website. 
      (2)Examples of such behavior include drinking while working on essays to decrease brain function, and taking 2 UROPs while taking Unified
      (3)These accomplishments include mastering the Chinese language solely by watching Ni Hao, Kai-Lan and attending class, not because of necessity, but as a courtesy to the teacher.

    name: Gerardo Segura

    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)

      On the night of February 26, 2000, an oil rig about 1.3 km. off the coast of Beaumont, Texas began to emit a deep, powerful, MOIST schlupping sound. Within a few minutes, it had squirted some ~300 barrels of crude into the stagnant surrounding waters, killing so many fish that the decaying corpses quickly warmed the sea to 37℃, the temperature of freshly drawn human blood. The fumes from the rotting fish reacted with the industrial exudates of the maquiladoras across the border, and dyed the air with a thick crimson, the throbbing, organic red of an infected eye.
      The younger, more cynical oilmen, there only for a few years to earn a bit and move on with their lives, will tell you that the spill was a natural tragedy. It was nothing more than gas buildup and faulty engineering, for “the earth has bubbles as the water has, and these are of them.” But the old men, those who’ve been there for as long as memory, might tell you otherwise. They have a reverence for the abyss, and speak in hushed tones of a name passed down through generations: Khero Kharo, a native Karankawa term meaning “buried blood-spirit sent by the silver canoe on the Milky Way.” How dare we drill too deep, they whisper, and disturb powers that have slept for millenia?
      But these are superstitions, and the hallucinogenic effects of that night’s chemical fumes were apparently pretty similar to those of psilocybin, so who remembers for sure what really happened? What we do know, however, is that the very next morning in Beaumont, after the fumes had precipitated into a shower of fine, red dust, a child was born. This child, Gerardo Segura, would exhibit an almost supernatural intellect from a young age. As a student at Andover, he was indestructible, and left his peers behind in a cloud of (maybe slightly red) dust. Here at MIT, he’s experienced a meteoric rise through the leaderships of both PKT and SHPE, and we all must consider what his rise to power might mean for mankind. One meaning is clear: the brothers of PKT sure are fortunate to have this merciful, legitimately benevolent spirit on our side.
