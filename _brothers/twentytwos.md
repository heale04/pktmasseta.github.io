    name: Adit Abraham
    activities: Startlabs, Contrary Capital, reminiscing over wrestling
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Salisbury, MD
    quote: Hair dye is to be administered by professionals only.
    nickname: Adept Abe
    blurb: >
      Adit is a man who seeks opportunity. A sophomore rush, he dedicated his first year at the Institute to becoming the biggest entrepreneurship mans the world has ever seen. Now, hopeful undergraduate founders and sucessful entrepreneur alums alike approach him with zeal, hoping that Adit may grant them access to the enterprising community of MIT. Adit holds the keys to the castle, and by his unrivaled generosity we know there could be no better occupant of the throne.

      The Journey of Adit began at birth. Originally from New Delhi, the young boy moved to glorious Maryland at the precocious age of 8. He was an explorer, a seer of sights, a dabbler in youth wrestling, and when he finally came of age, he was enveloped by the blocky escape that is Minecraft. His survival skills were unrivaled, but his obsession eventually turned away from crafting networks of redstone and towards cultivating networks of <i>working professionals</i>. Adit became the unchallenged rival of LinkedIn, and even came close to connecting with the Daily Show's Hasan Minhaj. The DMs never stopped, opportunities flourished, and the man only found a worthy contender when he first entered the doors of PKT. 

      The Journey of Adit is far from over, and any man, woman, or child who has the honor to pass him by in the Infinite may be considered part of said Journey. Whatever his future may hold, it is inexorably linked to his brothers of Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity.

    name: Luke Igel
    activities: SBC, MIT Driverless, Startups
    major: Computer Science (6-3), Philosophy (24-1)
    hometown: Chanhassen, MN
    quote: x
    nickname: Mr. Stealyogurl (you should ask him about that)
    blurb: >
      You better hide your girl in the presence of this man. With his luscious locks of brown hair, Luke
      is known to charm any girl that sets their eyes upon him. Every word he speaks further allures
      them. Seriously, try having a conversation with him. I guarantee you this will be a one of a kind
      experience. Whether it’s about his startups ideas, metaphysical topics, or even conspiracy
      theories you will never get bored of what Luke has to say, with each conversation leaving you
      wishing for another. Also do not let his scrawny appearance deceive you. This man used to own
      a pair of the most amazing abs, now hidden away for the greater good of the world. Who knows
      what dangers might befall if he were to release the destructive powers of his abs. You’ll
      constantly find Luke running around campus with all the various extracurriculars he’s involved
      with. But as busy as he may be, this man will always have time to smash.

    major: Aerospace Engineering (16)
    hometown: Phoenixville, PA
    quote: Guys, it's not a phase.
    nickname: Herbie
    blurb: >
      Herbert(1) M. Turner IV, the proud king of the Hurbitat, hails from the small pond known as Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. As a thicc fish, Herbs has always pursued difficult challenges in life. If none can be found, Herbie has been known to sabotage his own success in order to increase the rigor of life(2). This motivated attitude led HMT to attend Phillips Academy Andover! There King Turner flourished and a passion for AeroAstro was ignited. To this day, some still refer to him as “MatchStick”. Humble MatchStick refuses to create a LinkedIn, as he needs no praise for his accomplishments(3). Inspired by his own image, Herbert aspires to build big rockets!!

  - initials: GUS
    name: Gerardo Segura
    activities: Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers
    major: Computer Science (6-3)
    hometown: Beaumont, TX
    quote: Big mans
    nickname: Gerry
    blurb: >
      On the night of February 26, 2000, an oil rig about 1.3 km. off the coast of Beaumont, Texas began to emit a deep, powerful, MOIST schlupping sound. Within a few minutes, it had squirted some ~300 barrels of crude into the stagnant surrounding waters, killing so many fish that the decaying corpses quickly warmed the sea to 37℃, the temperature of freshly drawn human blood. The fumes from the rotting fish reacted with the industrial exudates of the maquiladoras across the border, and dyed the air with a thick crimson, the throbbing, organic red of an infected eye.
      The younger, more cynical oilmen, there only for a few years to earn a bit and move on with their lives, will tell you that the spill was a natural tragedy. It was nothing more than gas buildup and faulty engineering, for “the earth has bubbles as the water has, and these are of them.” But the old men, those who’ve been there for as long as memory, might tell you otherwise. They have a reverence for the abyss, and speak in hushed tones of a name passed down through generations: Khero Kharo, a native Karankawa term meaning “buried blood-spirit sent by the silver canoe on the Milky Way.” How dare we drill too deep, they whisper, and disturb powers that have slept for millenia?
      But these are superstitions, and the hallucinogenic effects of that night’s chemical fumes were apparently pretty similar to those of psilocybin, so who remembers for sure what really happened? What we do know, however, is that the very next morning in Beaumont, after the fumes had precipitated into a shower of fine, red dust, a child was born. This child, Gerardo Segura, would exhibit an almost supernatural intellect from a young age. As a student at Andover, he was indestructible, and left his peers behind in a cloud of (maybe slightly red) dust. Here at MIT, he’s experienced a meteoric rise through the leaderships of both PKT and SHPE, and we all must consider what his rise to power might mean for mankind. One meaning is clear: the brothers of PKT sure are fortunate to have this merciful, legitimately benevolent spirit on our side.
  - initials: CJL
    name: Chih-Wei Joshua Liu
    activities: Research, Volunteering, Church, Peer Ears, PKT Community Service Chair, Pre-Med Stuff, Being a great friend
    major: Physics (8)
    hometown: Santa Clara, CA & Hsinchu, Taiwan
    quote: Oh, uhh, yeah, sure
    nickname: Josh
    blurb: >
       Passionate and compassionate, dedicated and humble – just four of the many adjectives the brothers of the Phi Kappa Theta use to describe Joshua Liu, a true king amongst men who cares too much about saving humanity to join business clubs. Some of his other attributes include being philosophical, in a Nostradamic fashion, and slightly intimidatingly efficient at all aspects of life, as every good premed is (but especially Josh, @med schools). An early morning hustler, Josh can be spotted grinding on large biochemistry textbooks or yelling at PKT brothers to do their community service requirements from sunrise to precisely midnight, as he always ensures to get his beauty sleep; however, don’t be mistaken, for he’s constantly an open ear to anyone in need, a mental health advocate on campus, and beautifully in touch with his emotions (as evidenced by his hidden acting talents). Josh is a man that you will learn to only love more with time, and one of PKT’s finest gems. And oh, umm, yeah, fun fact: he also has a fraternal twin brother at MIT named Julian!
  - initials: SVS
    name: Shreyas Srinivasan
    activities: AOPS, MCG, PokerBots
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Plainsboro, NJ
    quote: My hero
    nickname: DJ ShreyWay
    blurb: >
      Not long after sending Princeton a rejection letter and coming to MIT, Shreyas received an honorary doctorate in pull-game from Brandeis University. When he isn’t formulating combinatorial proofs, he’s making huge innovations in music theory as the best DJ that PKT has seen in decades. With jet-black hair complementing his ebony glasses that frame his chiseled visage, Shreyas towers over you at 6’0”—but ever since he was little, he has shown great promise in math, debate, and BollyX dancing. Women and trading firms alike find him irresistible, and if you spend enough time around Shreyas, you might just find that you feel the same way.
  - initials: TTA
    name: Tiwalayo Aina
    activities: Chocolate City, Smash (1st in PKT)
    major: Mathematics with Computer Science (18C), Finance (15-3)
    hometown: Allen, TX
    quote: THAT’S WIIIILLLD!
    nickname: Tiwaaaaaaa
    blurb: >
      According to Nigerian scripture, the Aina dynasty began when lightning struck the Library of Lagos. In an explosion of flame comparable to the burning of Alexandria, all of Africa’s books were fused into a singularity of knowledge. The gods rushed from the heavens to prevent the inevitable but they were too late. Tiwalayo Aina was born.

      Not even the Greek gods can achieve what this Nigerian prince could do at birth. Tiwa wrote Les Misérables in its original French at the age of three, and within two years had conquered the neighboring African tribes — alone — by fencing. At eight, he discovered the magic of mathematics, and by the age of eleven had written books on both real and complex analysis.

      Unsatisfied with an empire stretching across merely Africa, Tiwa set his sights abroad in the name of conquest. Upon leaving the sacred lands, however, he broke out into violent hives. Indeed, his fatal allergies to the world outside his homeland were the cost of his superhuman knowledge. Unafraid, he continued his quest to East Asia, where he caught a chronic case of yellow fever after challenging China’s best to a math competition. He won, of course.

      After a four hundred-year gap in recorded Nigerian history, of which Tiwa claims to have no recollection, he appeared on MIT’s campus. He can be found taking no fewer than eight classes each semester, sleeping no more than two hours every night, making no less than nine figures, and majoring in no fewer than three subjects.
  - initials: BMA
    name: Brendan Ashworth
    activities: Running, startlabs, Formula One
    major: Physics (8)
    hometown: Altadena, CA
    quote: Oh my Lanta! That’s a Big Nut.
    nickname: Bashworth
    blurb: >
      Many moons ago, outside Pasadena, California in the charming unincorporated-territory of Altadena, Brendan triumphantly emerged from the womb. Bashworth is a true enigma. The man seemingly does and knows everything, moving with the smoothness of Swiss transportation. Although he was voted most likely to also be a serial killer, this evil genius is a charming, suave chad always looking to get a lil somethin’ on the side. Just take a minute to watch how effortlessly he dominates his opponents in pool or chess, and you’ll succumb like the rest of us. Brendan is usually a quiet fellow, but when he’s riled up the man is wild. He will start spurting out his favorite three-letter exclamatory remarks in lieu of any other legitimate reply or just to set the mood. Bet! Nut! Anti-Nut! Big sad! He repeatedly drops down like your favorite stripper, keeping a single arm erect as he busts it down, putting on a show for all. It’s a sight that makes even the most seasoned players swoon. Even still, Brendan could hold a beyond-competent conversation on quantum or particle physics. To top it off, Brendan is a classically trained negotiator who prefers the give-nothing-get-everything approach. Just what is he holding all his cards for? We still don’t know. 
  - initials: CMH
    name: Caleb Harris
    activities: Jumping, sleeping, startlabs, league of legends
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3), Brain and Cognitive Sciences (9)
    hometown: Nashville, TN
    quote: ASSSKRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRT
    nickname: Jumpman
    blurb: >
      Gifted to humanity in the small town of Pleasonton, California, Caleb exitted the womb already attired in the finest Italian garments money can buy. After 10 years in Pleasonton, he realized it would be criminal to withold his talents from the rest of the world and as such he rellocated to the one, the only, Nashville, Tennessee. It was here that his jumping ability was finally realized. Nowadays after having achieved peak jumping form he is rumored to be able to box jump entire buildings, however, because of his heart of gold, he chooses to limit his leaps during competitions in order to avoid destroying the spirits of all other competitors. When he's not jumping or tending to his personal silk worm farm, which he uses to weave his outfits daily you can find Caleb sleeping or listening to his favorite music genius, Young Thug. Though we may never get to observe a true Caleb Harris jump, we have already witnessed his greatest jump of all, into our hearts. 
  - initials: MAF
    name: Marc Felix
    activities: Sleeping, Volleyball, Robotics, Herbology
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Los Angeles, CA
    quote: WARNING - Beware of HAIR
    nickname: Bushman
    blurb: >
      Hailing from the sunny beaches and smoggy skies of LA, Marc checks both H’s as a hipster and a hacker.  Rocking a beanie and a luscious lock of finely groomed hair, the Bushman himself rocks a distinctive style not unlike that of our dear brother Stephen Otremba. As an algorithms expert, the wild bushman can most likely be found in his natural habitat… his room… sleeping.  Yet, when it comes to physics, the Bushman has yet to show up to a single 8.02 class.  The Bushman seeks sustenance during the day and frequents the water hole at the Stud where he fills up on Red Bull and Arizona.  With the physique of a young stud, the fur of Chewbacca, and the Primitive Survival Rating of tarzan himself, the Bushman is a jack of many trades- from dancing to electrical systems.  Keep your eyes on this young man; one moment he’s here, the next, he’s in your computer system.

    activities: Rowing, Pointing his finger at people, Car stuff, Not English
    major: Mechanical Engineering (2A)
    hometown: The Island of Misfit Toys, Massachusetts
    quote: Nice!
    nickname: Kal, Kal-L, Kev
    blurb: >
      Kevin. Oh, sweet Kevin. Our boy Kal-L is a lad of layers. From a distance, he’s just an incredibly attractive and very well-dressed young man. Step in close enough to hear him speak and you realize that you liked him better at a distance. The prevailing theory is that his mind relies on a recursive algorithm that builds unintelligible sentences from an array of independently logical phrases. Or perhaps the Portuguese brain in a Chinese body simply doesn’t allow for English communication. Whatever the reason for his mumbo-jumbo, Kevin is at heart one of the sweetest and most loving brothers in the house. Catch him vroomin’ in the all-white coupe or wandering around looking for his iPad stylus, Kevin Lu is a friend through and through.
  - initials: WWB
    name: Wesley Block
    activities: Singing, UROP, Basketball, MCG
    major: Materials Science and Engineering (3)
    hometown: Durham, NC
    quote: ...class flirt
    nickname: Wes
    blurb: >
      Born and raised in Durham, NC, Wes’s charm and sophistication makes any girl around him fall in love. Wes’s popularity has garnered him an extensive network of friends. While walking around campus, he’s sure to take his time, greeting every person that crosses his path. His charisma and soft voice will gain your trust, and you’ll soon find yourself opening up, revealing your deepest thoughts and secrets to him. Living by the mantra “value silence”, don’t be surprised if you catch him walking along the Harvard Bridge on a cold winter night. When he’s not overwhelmed with schoolwork, you could find Wes participating in extracurriculars around campus. From creating the technology behind Puma’s next basketball shoe, to partaking in the MIT Consulting Group, Wes is truly killing it.

    name: David Magrefty
    activities: StartMIT, Taekwondo
    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Ashdod, Israel
    quote: x
    nickname: Kravmagrefty
    blurb: >
      Is it David Beckham? Is it Dave Franco? No, it's actually David Magrefty.

      Born in Ashdod, Israel, David is a true gentleman that is fluent in the languages of Hebrew, English, Python, node.JS, CSS, and love. Some see him as an army commander, we see him as a brother, and your girlfriend probably sees him as the man she wishes you could be. He's rigorously trained in the deadly martial art of Krav Maga but his stunning looks and charm are still the most lethal thing about him. When he isn't busy fielding stares from everyone in a 3-mile radius, David is usually busy finishing a pset due next semester in the MacGregor study room (either that or he's busy founding the next unicorn at MTC).
