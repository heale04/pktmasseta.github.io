    name: Adit Abraham

    major: Computer Science and Engineering (6-3)
    hometown: Salisbury, MD

    nickname: Adept Abe
    blurb: >
      Adit is a man who seeks opportunity. A sophomore rush, he dedicated his first year at the Institute to becoming the biggest entrepreneurship mans the world has ever seen. Now, hopeful undergraduate founders and sucessful entrepreneur alums alike approach him with zeal, hoping that Adit may grant them access to the enterprising community of MIT. Adit holds the keys to the castle, and by his unrivaled generosity we know there could be no better occupant of the throne.

      The Journey of Adit began at birth. Originally from New Dehli, the young boy moved to glorious Maryland at the precocious age of 8. He was an explorer, a seer of sights, a dabbler in youth wrestling, and when he finally came of age, he was enveloped by the blocky escape that is Minecraft. His survival skills were unrivaled, but his obsession eventually turned away from crafting networks of redstone and towards cultivating networks of <i>working professionals</i>. Adit became the unchallenged rival of LinkedIn, and even came close to connecting with the Daily Show's Hasan Minhaj. The DMs never stopped, opportunities flourished, and the man only found a worthy contender when he first entered the doors of PKT. 

      The Journey of Adit is far from over, and any man, woman, or child who has the honor to pass him by in the Infinite may be considered part of said Journey. Whatever his future may hold, it is inexorably linked to his brothers of Phi Kappa Theta Fraternity.

    nickname: Herbie
    blurb: >
      Herbert(1) M. Turner IV, the proud king of the Hurbitat, hails from the small pond known as Phoenixville, Pennsylvania. As a thicc fish, Herbs has always pursued difficult challenges in life. If none can be found, Herbie has been known to sabotage his own success in order to increase the rigor of life(2). This motivated attitude led HMT to attend Phillips Academy Andover! There King Turner flourished and a passion for AeroAstro was ignited. To this day, some still refer to him as “MatchStick”. Humble MatchStick refuses to create a LinkedIn, as he needs no praise for his accomplishments(3). Inspired by his own image, Herbert aspires to build big rockets!!
