### PKT Gym

The brand new PKT gym, built over IAP 2016, offers a squat rack, bench press, deadlift platform, and free weights to keep our brothers in shape. The gym is also home to our bike rack.

### The Kitchen

Our full-scale kitchen contains everything we need to satisfy our late night brownie cravings. Also, there's an open pantry, and with all the leftovers from dinners, food is never a problem.
