### The Kitchen

###### Food is no Problem

Our full-scale kitchen contains everything we need to satisfy our late night brownie cravings. Also, there's an open pantry, and with all the leftovers from dinners, food is rarely a problem.

###### Gill Grilling

Our chef prepares our meals here, Sunday-Thursday. Yet, brothers often use the kitchen on the weekends to prepare the standard college cuisine: spaghetti or Ramen noodles. Others prepare more advanced culinary delights.

### Bike Room

###### Bike Closet

The first rooms you'll see here are the Bar Room and the Bike Closet. The Bar Room contains several bike racks, the House Manager's closet, and most importantly, lots of space for random storage.

###### Short Bike Ride to Campus

It's very convienent to have a bike. Five minutes to campus or less!
