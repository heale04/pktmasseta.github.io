We live in a four-story, century-old brownstone in Boston's affluent Back Bay. Our house serves as our home away from home - it's where we can unwind after hours of problem sets, catch dinner, hang out, and wander into random philosophical discussions late at night.

Our house overlooks the beautiful, tree-lined, Commonwealth Avenue Mall. One block away is Newbury Street, world-famous for its restaurants, boutiques, and stores. A short walk brings you to Fenway Park, the Prudential Mall, Boston Common, and the Boston Public Library. Also, with the Copley T station two blocks away, all of Boston can be reached in minutes. And MIT is only a five-minute bike ride away.
