We live in a four-story, century-old brownstone in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood. Our house serves as our home away from home - it's where we can unwind after hours of problem sets, catch dinner, hang out, and wander into random philosophical discussions late at night with our favorite people.

Our house overlooks the beautiful, tree-lined, Commonwealth Avenue Mall. One block away is Newbury Street, world-famous for its restaurants, boutiques, and stores. A short walk brings you to Fenway Park, the Prudential Mall, Boston Common, and the Boston Public Library. Also, with the Copley T station two blocks away, all of Boston can be reached in minutes. And MIT's campus is only a five-minute bike ride away.
