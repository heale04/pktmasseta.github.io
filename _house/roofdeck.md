### Roofdeck

###### Great View

Our roofdeck offers a great view of the Commonwealth Mall. At the back, you can see a bit of MIT's big dome. Usually every July 4th, brothers and friends gather here for good company, good food, and good fun. We have an excellent view of the fireworks over the river.

###### Grilling

We have plenty of seating for all kinds of grills and hangouts atop our beautiful boston home at 229 Comm Ave. The roof is also a great wingman.

###### Just Over the Charles

If you peer between some of the buildings, you catch a glimpse of the Great Dome of MIT.
