### Roofdeck

###### Great View

Our roofdeck offers a great view of the Commonwealth Avenue Mall. Every July 4th, brothers and friends gather here for good company, good food, and good fun. We have an excellent view of the fireworks show over the Charles River.

###### Grilling

We have plenty of seating for all kinds of grills and hangouts atop our beautiful Bsoston home at 229 Comm Ave. The roof is also a great wingman.

###### Just Over the Charles

If you look to the river-side and peer between some of the buildings, you'll catch a glimpse of the Great Dome of MIT.
