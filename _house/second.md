### Chapter

The Chapter Room is the nicest room in the house. We put in a lot of work to maintain the furniture and original wood paneling. With stadium couch seating lining the far wall, our Chapter room is the perfect place to hold our weekly house meetings where all brothers come together and vote on house policies.

Brothers often use this room to practice piano, pset, or take calls. When friends of brothers visit, the room also serves as a guest room.

The plaques on the walls distinguish awards from both the National PKT fraternity and MIT itself. PKT is a proud three-time winner of the Founder's cup (awarded to the nation's best chapter). At MIT, we've won awards for best pledge program, community service, risk management, and more.

### Ballroom

###### Ballroom Dances

Before we bought the house from its original owner, a rich doctor, this entire second floor used to be one large floor where ballroom parties would be held. Ergo, we choose the name Ballroom for the lone brother bedroom on this floor.

###### Original Ceiling

Originally, the entire 2nd floor was connected as one large "Ballroom" with extravagant furnshings and fixtures. Even the ceiling in this room used to be as exquisite as that of the Chapter Room. This floor really shows the history of our house!

###### Lofted Beds

All the beds are lofted while the desks are on the floor. The Ballroom is very spacious. It is the largest room by volume in the house. This room is usually a quad during the year.

### The Pit

###### Who wants to live in a pit?

This is where the orchestra sat when it performed in the parties. Being underneath the platform of beds in the ballroom, though, it is the also the actual pit of the ballroom.

###### Residential Advisor

Our graduate residential adviser (GRA), Preston Powers lives here. Preston currently studies dentistry at the Harvard School of Dental Medicine. When he's not performing as a professional DJ at the many night clubs of Boston, he's studying in the Pit or working in his dental clinic.

### Second Bath

Each floor has one bathroom, and each is unique in their own way. This particular bathroom has a map of the entire Back Bay neighborhood. A while back, a group of freshman (Pledge class 87, class of 91) had to go to the local supermarket for supplies, but they didn’t even know where it was. So the personnel director made them go into Back Bay and make a map so they wouldn’t forget. They did one better and painted the entire map!
