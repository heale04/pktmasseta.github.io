###### How important is alcohol at PKT?

Alcohol, in whatever form it may be consumed, is not a big part of PKT. Some brothers drink, some don't. It's one's individual choice to drink or not drink and no brother or pledge is ever pressured to consume alcohol.

###### Is there hazing at PKT?

If you pledge PKT, be rest assured, you WILL NOT be hazed. Our chapter has a strict policy of no hazing. We treat our pledges with care and respect to help them grow as individuals and adjust to college life. Hazing has no part in this and we are very careful to never require anything of pledges that could be construed as hazing by any party.

###### Is there a Hell Week?

As just stated, we have a strict policy of no hazing. We consider the so-called Hell Week some other fraternities have to be a form of hazing and therefore we do not convene a hell week in which we require pledges to do all sorts of things. We do have work weeks, once during IAP, and once during the summer before rush, in which brothers and pledges work alongside each other to fix up the house.

###### What makes PKT different from other houses?

This is a hard question to answer, for until you personally experience a place, you cannot really understand what makes it unique. Each house has its own personality and PKT is no different. We believe our house is marked by a very strong brotherhood (no doubt you've heard this word a lot recently), a great sense of humor, and strong moral character. Every house will inevitably claim to have a strong brotherhood. All we can say is that there is a lot of love and support in PKT, so much so that we think of this as our home and family. The close relationships we have here will last throughout our lives. We do not take ourselves too seriously and feel comfortable joking around with each other. All fraternities were founded upon Christian principles and ideals. We take our founding ideals seriously and strive to become better men by living with integrity.

###### How religious is PKT?

We respect each other's individual beliefs and opinions. Many brothers are members of different churches and are involved in on-campus fellowships. There is no pressure to be more or less religious than you want to be.

###### What is the reputation of PKT?

PKT will never be called the jock house (although we have our share of varsity athletes and excel in intramural sports) or the party house (although we have a diverse social calendar). We do, however, take pride in being known as a bunch of nice guys who like to have fun and have a great sense of humor.

###### How long is the associate member program?

Our pledge program does not have a predetermined length. Basically, the pledge period ends when the brothers decide the pledges are ready. Our pledge program runs no later than the end of the first semester.

###### What is the smoking policy?

We do not allow smoking inside our house.

###### How far is it to campus?

That depends on how you get there. Many brothers bike to campus, which takes five to ten minutes. On foot, it's a 15-20 minute walk to campus. But one can often catch the bus across the river, which makes the trip much shorter.
