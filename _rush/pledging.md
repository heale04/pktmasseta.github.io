###### What is Pledging Like?

You may be asking yourself, "What will my life be like if I pledge PKT?" We incorporate freshman into our house through our Associate Member program designed to familiarize pledges with the house, MIT, and the Boston area. We do this in a way that fosters relationships between our pledges and the upperclassmen, as well as among the pledge class itself. These relationships are the driving force behind the entire program, and everything we do works towards strengthening them. Our pledge program has previously been recongnized by MIT IFC as the top new-member program among all MIT fraternities, and it's something we take a great deal of pride in.

###### Pledge PKT, and Get a Free Big Brother

As part of the Associate Member program, each member of the pledge class selects a big brother, who helps them adjust to life at the house and MIT. The Big Brother acts as a pedge's go-to for any question or concern they have about school or social life; an upperclassman mentor. Our goal is to make our incoming members feel at home in the house, while developing a sense of pride in the fraternity and themselves, ultimately becoming men we are proud to call brothers.


###### How Will My Personality fit into my Plegde Class?

Joining Phi Kappa Theta doesn't mean you have to relinquish your personality. We pride ourselves on our varying backgrounds and perspectives. We have our share of sports enthusiasts and artists, pyrotechnicians and pranksters, socialites and studiers, engineers and humanitarians, east coasters and west coasters, meat eaters and vegetarians, and everything in between. In other words, it's easy to just be yourself at PKT.
