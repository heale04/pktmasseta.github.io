###### Location

Our house is located right in the heart of Back Bay. Living at PKT gives you access to nearby grocery stores like CVS and Star Market, multiple dining options on Newbury and Boylston Street, and leisure opportunities at the Commonwealth mall, Boston Commons, and Charles River Esplanade. We are also located just a short walk away from the Copley Green Line T Staion, allowing you to get anywhere you need to be in Boston.

###### Kitchen

Our house basement is equipped with a full size industrial kitchen for all of your culinary needs. Our cooking station comes complete with six burners and two ovens, and you'll be able to store your food in our industrial freezer, refridgerator, or pantry. There is also a house grill that can be used in our back lot to host some great summer barbecues!

###### Gym

Also located in the basement, our gym comes with a squat rack, benchpress area, deadlift stand, and all kinds of dumbbells and freeweights. Feel free to play music and keep up your fitness here during your stay with PKT. Maybe even start a workout group with your roommates!

###### Laundry

Located right by our back door area is our laundry room. It comes with two washing machines and two drying machines that are free to use with your own detergent. Residents sign up to use the machines using a calendar shared among the residents of the house.

###### Common Areas

There are a number of common areas in our house for residents to use to mingle, watch a movie, or have a few friends over. Our first floor living room area comes with couches, a TV for watching movies and sports, a pool table, ping pong table, and a foosball table. We also have speakers and a DJ stand set up for you to play some music and liven up the area.

On the fourth floor, we have a lounge area underneath our roof skylight complete with a projector and speaker system that makes for some great house movie nights!

Most rooms also come with a couch or two, so if you and your roommates are comfortable with having other residents in your room to hang out, feel free!

###### Rooftop Deck

One of the best parts of our house, our rooftop deck provides an excellent view of the Boston skyline and a bird's eye view of the beautiful Commonwealth mall. There are benches and a picnic table on the deck for lounging in the sun on nice afternoons or catching the sunset in the evenings. The roof also gives the perfect viewpoint to watch the fireworks on the Fourth of July!

###### Bathrooms

Every residential floor in the house comes with a full bathroom with stalls, sinks, and a closed shower area.
