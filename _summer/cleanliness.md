### Something we can all appreciate

###### Weekly Cleaning Service

Although residents will be responsible for keeping their own rooms and dishes clean, a weekly cleaning service will be hired to pick up common areas of the house every Sunday this summer. The cleaners will service all lounges, bathrooms, hallways, and the kitchen so that residents can have a clean and comfortable environment to live in. 

This service is provided for no additional cost.
