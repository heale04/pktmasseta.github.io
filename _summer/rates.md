### Rooms, Rates & Add-Ons

###### Triples

We will have three triples available for rent this summer. These rooms include Virginia and Peck located on the third floor of the house, and Flying located on the fourth floor. 

###### Quads

Four quads will be available for rent. These rooms include Sunrise and Tomb located on the third floor, and Studio and Beer located on the fourth floor. For more information about our rooms and a bit about their places in PKT house lore, visit the [House](https://pkt.mit.edu/house/) tab of this website.

###### Other Rooming Options

If you really want to stay in a double or even a single, we may be able to negotiate something. Indicate this when you fill out the interest form, and email Stephen Otremba at pkt-summerhousing@mit.edu.

###### Room Rates

Triples: $2600
Quads: $2100

These prices are per person and are total, all-inclusive prices for the entire summer. If you do choose to stay with us this summer, we will also request an additional $500 security deposit which will be refunded after your move out date.

###### Parking

If you have a car that you would like to have access to this summer, we have four parking spots available for rent in our back lot.  The price for a spot is $300 and will cover parking for the entire summer housing period.
