				<h3>Flying Bedroom</h3>

				<h6>No Ladders?</h6>
				<p>The beds are lofted, but there are no ladders. Puzzled? That is because the residents of this room pull themselves up into their lofts with these ropes. The one exception is during the summer, when the room is inhabited by female boarders. We provide ladders for them.</p>

				<h6>Bed Wars</h6>
				<p>Once, the beds were not bolted and freely swing, serving as vehicles for "bed wars". However, after a freak accident occurred, the beds were bolted to the walls. This room is a triple.</p>

				<h6>Home Sweet Home</h6>
				<p>Some Californians lived in this room and really missed the West Coast weather so they painted a giant beach on the walls. If you can't go there, just bring it with you!</p>

				<h3>Canyon Bedroom</h3>

				<h6>Super Quad</h6>
				<p>As the most spacious room of the house, the Canyon is a quad. Most recently we built a triple bunk. The room also has a large lounge area and couches, serving as the location for random conversations or social gatherings. Or you could practice your bowling with Greg Puszko '13 and Saif Hakim '14 in here.</p>

				<h6>House Lore</h6>
				<p>The story of the canyon is as follows: There was this alum who came back and told us that there was a mural of the grand canyon painted across the walls of the room, which is why we called it the grand canyon. But, we asked a second alum, and he recalled no such thing. He then noted that the first alum dropped a lot of acid and smoked lots of weed.</p>

				<h3>Studio Bedroom</h3>

				<h6>Wall of Fame</h6>
				<p>The Music Wall of Fame is limited to only the most influential musicians of all time that are also either dead or disbanded.</p>

				<h6>Taking the A Train...</h6>
				<p>They also painted a musical score along the top of the wall. Can you guess it? Duke Ellington - Taking the A Train. It also contains a purple crayon marking of Jimmy Hendrix's Tomb stone.</p>

				<h3>Beer Bedroom</h3>

				<h6>A Unique Room</h6>
				<p>This room is really unique. Pledges from other chapters from UNH or Merrimack come to our house and have to take a picture of this room to prove that they were here.</p>

				<h6>The Catalogue</h6>
				<p>If you look around, you can see why this is called the Beer Room. The collection was started in the late 80s by alumnus Mark Jansen. He was traveling through Europe and found some neat bottles and decided to send them back to the house. Ever since then, anyone who's gone abroad or found unique beer bottles sends them back to the house. Every single beer is catalogued into a database and arranged alphabetically. Few have stumped us.</p>

				<h6>Peer Pressure?</h6>
				<p>Some brothers drink, but no one is obligated to drink and we have a lot of brothers who don't drink alcohol. We respect your right to choose, and alcohol is not an important part of who we are.</p>

				<h3>Fourth Floor Bathroom</h3>

				<h6>Team Mural</h6>
				<p>Gaze around and realize that what you see here is a product of Team Mural: a select group of PKT's finest artisans. During winter work week 2003, this group completely renovated this bathroom based on a Dr. Seuss theme. Each stall panel carefully depicts the PKT version of the popular children's characters. Team Mural is still intact, and hopefully will ride off into the sunset after many more glorious murals.</p>
