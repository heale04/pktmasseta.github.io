	<h3>Survival Guide</h3>
	<h5>Rush 2015</h5>

	<p>Choosing a living group is one of the most important decisions of your MIT career, and we want to do our best to clear up any confusion you might have about the process. What follows shows some of the things for you to think about during rush and your freshman year. We hope that this provides some important pointers on how rush works and, at the same time, gives you an idea of what our house is like.</p>
	<h6>Rush Is...</h6>
	<p>
	A period during which fraternities and other living groups at MIT hold various events, from Lobster Dinners to Paintball outings, to meet and recruit prospective members.
	Intended to help freshmen find the group they feel most comfortable with.</p>
	<h6>Some Advice</h6>
	<p>Be open to meet people of all shapes and sizes. Make an effort to stay that way, or else you'll quickly close yourself off from many exciting people.<br>
	Be yourself! If you feel uncomfortable doing this, maybe you should rush somewhere else.
	Ask lots of questions. (see below)<br>
	Spend lots of time at the house and get to know the brothers as well as possible in the time that you have.<br>
	During rush, visit 5 houses at most; you need to spend time getting to know the brothers at a house, and they need to get to know you to give you a bid.<br>
	Don't be upset if you get referred to another house. Houses do not want to waste your time.<br> If you aren't going to get a bid, you will probably be told so and shown to another house where you will fit in better.<br></p>
	<h6>Important Questions to Ask</h6>
	<p>
	Where is your house located?<br>
	How many brothers live in the house?<br>
	Is there hazing?<br>
	What will the pledge program entail?<br>
	How are the house responsibilities and chores distributed?<br>
	How important is partying to the house?<br>
	What were your reasons for joining this house?<br></p>
	<h6>Girls During Rush</h6>
	<p>
	If you hit it off with a cute freshman girl, convince her to come along on your first few fraternity visits.<br>
	If you hit it off with a cute upperclassman at a fraternity, well...not to burst your bubble or anything, but that's her job.<br>
	Warning: Girls hanging out at fraternities during Rush give you an idea about social life there...only to an extent. Don't be a fool and think that you'll be surrounded by women once Rush is over. Choose a house for the bros, not the girls.</p>
